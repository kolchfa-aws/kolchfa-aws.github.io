I'm a technical writer with 10+ years of experience, a former software developer with a Master's degree in Computer Science, and a math and AP Computer Science tutor. 

Currently, I am working as a senior programmer writer at AWS, documenting [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/)---an open-source distributed search and analytics engine.

I use the _docs-as-code_ process to create documentation, which includes testing the features I describe. During testing, I sometimes uncover [bugs](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/issues/561), craft helpful error messages, and suggest workflow enhancements---improving not only the documentation, but the software itself.

## Docs-as-code

I implement automation to streamline and improve the documentation workflow, for example:

- A [Vale linter](https://opensearch.org/blog/style-workflow/) for style and spelling consistency
- A script to publish documentation to a staging site
- An automated release notes generator from GitHub PRs

## UI

To improve usability and visual clarity, I design and build custom UI elements that enhance the documentation experience.
