  - excerpt: "As a former software developer, I bring strong technical expertise to documentation. While documenting features, I serve as \"patient zero\", identifying and resolving issues, such as unclear workflows or confusing terminology, before they impact users. As a result, I create clear, useful documentation that helps users understand complex concepts and start using the software with confidence."
